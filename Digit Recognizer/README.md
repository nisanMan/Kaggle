# Digit Recognizer

## Overview
This project aims to recognize handwritten digits using various machine learning algorithms and techniques.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn

## Dataset
The dataset consists of handwritten digit images in grayscale format. It is commonly used for training various image processing systems. You can download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data).

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed.
3. Run the notebook to perform exploratory data analysis and train machine learning models.
4. Analyze the results and model performance.

## Models Used
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC) (Best Score: 0.975)
- Logistic Regression (Score: 0.91617)
- Neural Network (Custom 4-layer, 3 Activation Functions) (Max Score: 0.89)

## Custom Approach
The custom approach involves building a model based on matrix multiplication to recognize digits. The highest achieved score using this approach is 0.82.
